One of our main goals is understanding the regulatory circuits that govern cell growth and how those circuits react to perturbations such as nutrient limitations or drug treatment. We approach this question using both data-driven and model-driven methods: we make use of data provided from our experimental collaborators to build models, and we plan new experiments based on our models to test the model predictions. We are actively working on E. coli, yeast and cultured mammalian cell lines, to find common and specific traits of growth regulation.</p>

New dynamic single-cell data challenge standard views and raise new questions. Quantitative models are needed to infer the key mechanisms and guide the experiments. In E. coli, with single-cell experiments, extensive data-analysis and modeling study, we have recently reported that a concurrency between processes happening both at the chromosome and the cell level typically limit cell division with comparable odds, which vey with conditions and perturbations. In single cultured mammalian cells, we have shown that both subperiod timing adjustments and growth-rate regulation contribute to cell-cycle progression decisions. In yeast and in breast cancer cells, we are currently exploring how the extreme deviation of cell size from homeostatic values during a G1 cell-cycle arrest can affect cell proliferation after release from the arrest.</p>
